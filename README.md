# NCLIM-19122723
##Introduction
This branch provides the code and data of the paper NCLIM-19122723.
The name of this branch is NCLIM-19122723, under the respositories.
You can share it use: https://github.com/pkufubo/OSCAR/tree/NCLIM-19122723.
The results in this study is run with OSCAR v2.2.
These codes need to run under python2 environment.
In addition, you need to download the numpy package and the scipy package, they are both very common python packages.

repositories is for the paper NCLIM-19122723,
with title "Short-lived climate forcers have a long-term
climate forcing through the carbon-climate feedback"

All the results in the study can be reproduced using this repositories.
1 First, download OSCAR modle.
In this study, OSCAR v2.2 is used. The scripts can be run for OSCAR v2.x.
OSCAR modle is availabe: https://github.com/tgasser/OSCAR/tree/v2.2
2 Copy the scripts into the OSCAR path, and run them. Then you can get
the results in this study.
